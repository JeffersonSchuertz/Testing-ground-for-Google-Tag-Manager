# Testing-ground-for-Google-Tag-Manager
Static environment for testing tagging operations through GTM

How can I test my GTM account in this environment?
First fork this project.
In your project, in the index.html, sobre.html and analise.html files, you must replace the pair of scripts with the one generated by your account in GTM.
Host this project on your own GitHub account
My project is hosted here: https://jeffersonschuertz.github.io/Testing-ground-for-Google-Tag-Manager/

After that, all tag insertions will take place through your GTM account.

These are the same script snippets in the files in this repository. 
However, in this project, the hosted site is connected to the GTM account code: GTM-WJNZHF4
So, You must change to your own GTM account.
